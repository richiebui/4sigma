## Machine Learning project
This project was the introduction to our machine learning skills and implementing them to data set.
Our goal this project was to predict the saleprice of the given test set using the training set given to us.
We worked as a group and individually to produce the most efficient and most accurate sale price we can using the techniques we learned.
We ultimately made several success and failures throughout this project which helped us build a foundation for skillset and knowledge.
